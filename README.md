## 📸 Project Overview

```
Upload Football Video → YOLOv8 Detection → ByteTrack Tracking → Annotated Output Video
```

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| 🎯 Detection | Players, Ball, Goalkeeper, Referee |
| 🔁 Tracking | Unique ID per player across all frames |
| 🧠 Model | YOLOv8m fine-tuned with Transfer Learning |
| 📦 Dataset | Custom Roboflow football dataset |
| 🚀 Demo | Gradio web app |
| ⚡ Backend | PyTorch + CUDA |

## 🧠 How It Works

### Transfer Learning Pipeline

```
YOLOv8m (pretrained on COCO 80 classes)
        ↓
Backbone layers FROZEN  (keeps general features)
        ↓
Detection head FINE-TUNED on football dataset
        ↓
Custom model: detects players, ball, referee, goalkeeper
```

### Tracking Pipeline

```
Frame 1 → Detect players → Assign IDs
Frame 2 → Detect players → Match IDs with ByteTrack
Frame N → Consistent IDs across entire video ✅
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Open in Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JenilGoti/Football-Player-Tracker./blob/main/Football_Player_Tracker.ipynb)

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install ultralytics roboflow gradio torch torchvision
```

### 3. Run Detection on a Video

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("runs/detect/football_project/weights/best.pt")

model.track(
    source="your_football_video.mp4",
    tracker="bytetrack.yaml",
    save=True,
    conf=0.4
)
```
